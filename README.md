## Hi there 👋

I'm Jayden, a security engineer based in Australia.

I focus on identity, networking, and building secure, reliable systems.

My work usually sits at the intersection of architecture, automation, and open-source tooling. I enjoy elegant technical solutions, improving security posture, and understanding how complex systems fit together.

My favourite project is [blackwire](https://github.com/SniperThrilla/blackwire), my L2 VPN built from scratch.

Always open to collaborating on open source, security research, or anything that pushes my skills forward!

Fun Facts:
- Black belt in Taekwondo, so yes I can kick my servers when they misbehave
- I read active directory docs for fun (concering, I know)
- I'm building a full homelab with AD because I refuse to learn things the normal way
- My hobbies include: breaking things, fixing them, then pretending that was the plan all along
